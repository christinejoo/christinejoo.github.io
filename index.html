                  <p>Reading Notes — <br> Grapefruit</p>

                  <p>At first, I was confused as to where the traditional reading content was and continued to scroll to find that the text in this book is very conceptual and prompts the reader to think rather than mindlessly read. This reading has some parallels to our instructional drawing exercise in that it presents instructions and invites readers to engage with the text.

                  <p>Reading Notes — <br>Jodi's Infrastructure, Alexander R. Galloway</p>

                  <p>Jodi (artist duo) work with infinite structures while using the computer as a medium. "Working on" is seen as modern (medium is the message) and "working within" is non-modern (content becomes own context).

                <p>Reading Notes — <br>A Handmade Web, J.R. Carpenter</p>

                <p>Handmade web refers to web pages coded by hand, they challenge conventions through a personal aesthetic. The handmade web refers to manual labor of the physical body — through work by the hand (coding), brower becomes real. "Ironically, handheld devices have distanced us from the handmade web."
                </p>

                <p>This reading makes me think about the style of a lot of Parsons faculty and students, pushing the expressivity of code more than the commerical aesthetic. Also, thinking about exploring different possibilites of the web especially as a student.

                <p> The Challenge for me... working previously in more user experience based design, trying to find a balance between that functionality and personal expressivity, especially in this class.
