                        During the brainstorming process, I was inspired by the Australian Open NFT Balls and Premier League soccer ball patterns. Here's the <a href="https://www.are.na/share/tDHHAgk">link to my are.na channel</a> where I collected inspiration and my proposal deck.

                        Week 02 — First Iteration
                        <br>

                        For the first week, I focused on prototyping a basic object. I looked into shaders in p5.js and used different colors to randomly draw circles on a sphere.

                        For the second iteration, I worked with my p5.js sketch further.

                        <br>

                        For the third iteration, I worked on making an array of 100 color combinations to represent the different soccer clubs. I got feedback to work on making a seamless design.

                        Week 05 — Fourth Iteration + Further
                        <br>

                        For the fourth week, I discovered code using three.js which prompted a learning curve. I did a lot of trial and error with three.js and p5.js as I had different successful parts from both explorations.
